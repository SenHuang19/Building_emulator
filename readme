This repo includes building emulators and interfacing capability using docker and docker compose.

Specifically, emulators operate as a "server" while controllers for testing are considered as "client".

1. Please note that you will need to install docker-compose and make in order to execute the above commands.

   To install docker-compose, please refer to https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

   To install make for Windows, please refer to http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm
 
2. Commands for executing building emulators are included in the make file

   - build the images by executing "make build"

   - run the images by executing "make run"

   - copy the result files out of the images by executing "make copy"

   - remove the images by executing "make remove"
   
   Note that actuators or supervisory control inputs in emulators can be overridden using the available interface.

   If emulators do not receive any override commands it will advance the simulation based on the existing control baseline.

3. Testing control
	
	Clients can be implemented in any programming languages that support HTTP communications.

	This repo contains two examples: a julia-based client (julia_control/interface.jl) and a python client (python_control/runSimulation.py)

	Develop your controllers based on those examples.

    Note that in the client side, simulation length [s] and starting time [s] can be adjusted:

     for the julia client

           simulation length [s] is defined in the line 33 of julia_control/interface.jl
		   

           starting time [s] is defined in the line 110 of julia_control/interface.jl

     for the python client

           simulation length [s] and starting time [s] are defined in the line 7 of docker-compose_python.yml
